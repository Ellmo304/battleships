###Overview
The idea of this project was to incorporate and implement the range of skills we had learned over the first couple of weeks of the WDI course.

###Aim
* To make a project using seperate HTML, CSS and JavaScript files
* To have a working game by deadline, hosted on Heroku
* To present my project to the rest of the group, explaining my working process 

###Process
* First I wireframed how my page would look and what I would need to display on screen
* Next I created a Trello board to plan my steps, ordered by priority
* I created my index.html file with all the elements I would need
* Next I wrote the game logic in my app.js file using JavaScript and jQuery
* After testing the game thoroughly, I styled the project using CSS3 and adding audio files to my project

###Biggest wins
* Writing the function allowing the AI to place ships at random on its board
* Creating a hover class with visual stylings to allow the player to see where their ships will go as they move around the grid, before they confirm placement, which triggers a different class on those tiles

###Challenges faced
* The biggest challenge I faced was writing the functions to set up the game board. The computer needed to be able to place ships randomly on its gameboard without overlapping or straying from the edges of the grid. The player also needed the same functionality with control over ship rotation
* Another tough task at this stage was to stay on top of my code and to make it as streamlined as possible whilst retaining full functionality

###Steps for improvement
* I plan to improve the game by making the AI smarter, so it can kill off a players ship once it has made a hit
* I could further style the page to include instructions for those who are unfamiliar with the game
